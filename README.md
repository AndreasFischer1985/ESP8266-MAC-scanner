# ESP8266-MAC-scanner
This code enables an ESP8266 device to scan/detect MAC addresses. You may upload it to an ESP8266 using the [Arduino IDE](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/how-to-install-esp8266-board-arduino-ide/). With small additions, the code can be used to measure the number of active devices in the smart home or to react to your own MAC address in a certain way.
